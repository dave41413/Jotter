# Jotter

Jotter is a lightweight notes app with AI-style helpers for drafting and summarizing notes.
The AI tools run locally with smart templates so you can explore the workflow without an API key.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
